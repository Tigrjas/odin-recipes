    <p>This Mediterranean pearl couscous, with zucchini, tomatoes, pine nuts, and capers, is loaded with flavor and is a

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup Israeli couscous</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter </li>
        <li>1 medium zucchini, quartered and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon roughly chopped capers</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, add couscous, and cook until tender, about 14 minutes. Remove
            from heat.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, drain couscous thoroughly, and return to the pot.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add pine nuts and toast, stirring
            frequently, until golden brown and fragrant, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove pine nuts from skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same skillet. Add zucchini; saut√© for 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and capers. Cook on
            medium-high, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes; season
            with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced in volume, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in couscous and toasted pine nuts. If the sauce seems dry, gradually add reserved cooking water, 1
            tablespoon at a time, until sauce is desired consistency. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
